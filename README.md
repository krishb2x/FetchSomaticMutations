# FetchSomaticMutations
Hi, I have developed this pipeline developed for an interview Assignment to perform somatic mutation analysis on tumor and normal samples. Thus design follows specific protocols given for the assignment, not clinical NGS standards.
It includes quality control, alignment, mutation calling, and background mutation calculation.
